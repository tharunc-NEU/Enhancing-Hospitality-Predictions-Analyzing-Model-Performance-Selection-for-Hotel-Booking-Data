# Enhancing-Hospitality-Predictions-Analyzing-Model-Performance-Selection-for-Hotel-Booking-Data

This GitHub project offers a thorough exploration of hotel industry analytics, placing a spotlight on the creation and deployment of an advanced Cancellation Prediction model. The project's significance lies in its multifaceted approach, combining meticulous feature selection techniques, including Pearson Correlation and Encoding, with the application of diverse models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

A key highlight is the project's dedication to optimizing predictive accuracy. This is achieved through the incorporation of sophisticated analysis methods such as Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve, ensuring a nuanced understanding of model performance. The utilization of cross-validation techniques further enhances the model's robustness, providing a reliable framework for decision-making in the hotel industry.

The emphasis on hyperparameter tuning underscores the commitment to fine-tuning the model for optimal results, contributing to sustained growth within the industry. By leveraging these advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, the project not only refines resource management and staffing strategies but also enhances overall operational efficiency.

In terms of data privacy, the dataset used in the project has undergone careful anonymization, with the removal of original personal identifying information and the introduction of duplicate values. This meticulous approach ensures compliance with privacy standards while maintaining the integrity and usefulness of the dataset.

The dataset itself encompasses comprehensive booking information for both city and resort hotels, serving as a valuable resource for enthusiasts and professionals seeking insights into the intricacies of the hotel booking process. Whether for academic exploration, industry research, or practical application, this project on GitHub stands as a comprehensive and well-documented contribution to the field of hotel industry analytics.
