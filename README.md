# Enhancing-Hospitality-Predictions-Analyzing-Model-Performance-Selection-for-Hotel-Booking-Data

This GitHub project provides a comprehensive exploration of hotel industry analytics, focusing on the development and deployment of an advanced Cancellation Prediction model. The project's significance lies in its multifaceted approach, blending meticulous feature selection techniques like Pearson Correlation and Encoding with diverse models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

A key highlight is the project's commitment to optimizing predictive accuracy, employing sophisticated analysis methods like Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve for a nuanced understanding of model performance. Cross-validation techniques enhance the model's robustness, providing a reliable framework for decision-making in the hotel industry.

The emphasis on hyperparameter tuning underscores the commitment to fine-tuning the model for optimal results, contributing to sustained industry growth. Leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, the project refines resource management, staffing strategies, and overall operational efficiency.

In terms of data privacy, the dataset used in the project undergoes meticulous anonymization, ensuring compliance with privacy standards by removing personal identifying information and introducing duplicate values while maintaining data integrity.

The project's value extends to its comprehensive dataset, encompassing booking information for both city and resort hotels. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for enthusiasts and professionals seeking insights into the intricacies of the hotel booking process. Whether for academic exploration, industry research, or practical application, this GitHub project stands as a well-documented and comprehensive contribution to hotel industry analytics.

Additionally, the feature importance chart within the project is a critical tool for understanding factors influencing the Average Daily Rate (ADR). This chart informs decision-making on pricing strategies and targeted marketing. The observed differences in feature importance suggest that strategies focusing on room types and catering to specific market segments or family compositions could be effective for revenue optimization.
